Process Checklist

A simple process checklist I created for my job in a 'collections' role. 

Also added a few nifty features to make my life easier while taking calls.

This was a very quick and messy page I put together to manage my call flow. As I went through each step I could click on it so it turns green - meaning that it was done. I also included reference material that I could easily access when required.
